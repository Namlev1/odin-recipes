    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest
        for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yeast</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Bread flour</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand
            mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5
            minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
